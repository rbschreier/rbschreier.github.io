    <h3>Explaining myself / email User Guide</h3>
    <ol>        
        <li>I'll avoid burdening you with unnecessary responses. You don't need to respond to me either :) </li>
        <li>I'll keep it short to respond to more mail faster. Short responses do not signal emotion.</li>
        <li>I use dictation for longer responses and apologize for any typos.</li>
        <li>I block email tracking pixels and trackers - lack of a read receipt doesn't mean I did not read your email.</li>
        <li>I use Gmail's priority inbox to deal with volume; apologies if I miss an email due to the algorithm.</li>
        <li>Typically, I can connect soonest via an unscheduled call - "phone tag". So I'll often ask for your number and initiate.</li>        
    </ol>    
    <br>
    I hope this approach puts fewer emails into the world so we can all spend more time on our passions and less time in our inbox. Thank you for your humoring me :)</li>
