    <h3>Explaining myself / User Guide</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I'll avoid burdening you with unnecessary responses. You don't need to respond to me either :) </li>
        <li>I'll keep it short to benefit us both. My short responses do not signal emotion.</li>
        <li>I use dictation for longer responses and apologize for any resulting typos.</li>
        <li>I block email tracking pixels and trackers.</li>
    </ol>    
    <br>
    I hope this approach puts fewer emails into the world so we can all spend more time on our passions and less time in our inbox :)</li>
