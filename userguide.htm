    <h3>Email Norms/User Guide for Bryan</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>I'll avoid burdening you with unnecessary responses (feel free to do the same).</li>
        <li>I'll keep it short to benefit us both (short responses are not intentionally curt).</li>
        <li>I use dictation for longer responses and apologize for any resulting typos.</li>
    </ol>
